      Crime Rates in Union County, New Jersey in 2021

      New Jersey is one of the most culture-filled cities in America, through the diversity it connects to its residents. Even though New Jersey is one of the most taxed states in the states, the residents are not shy about their state pride. However, the past months and years have had an increase in crime both in urban and suburban neighborhoods in New Jersey. With cities like Camden and Atlantic City, New Jersey is known to have spots that have increased crime rates, but we are starting to see this in other spots of NJ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at the chart above, these crimes were committed during a three-month span during January to March during 2021. This data has been made available to us from the New Jersey State Police website. The chart was able to show us the difference and comparison in different areas of counties in New Jersey, with Union County being one of the counties on top of the crime charts. Union County is in the middle of New Jersey, which is something residents fight over whether there is a central or non-central Jersey. 
    </p>
    <p>
     Growing up in New Jersey myself in a small town called New Providence, my parents were able to find a place where crime was not present, and the community is close to one another. I almost knew every single person on my street from every direction. However, looking back into my town and realizing the privilege I was able to have, the diversity that we see in New Jersey was not present in the town that I grew up in. After doing some research, about 80% of the community in New Providence is white. The second highest population next to that 80% is Asian resident who are around 15% in the town, with African Americans having less than 1% population in the town. Obviously, this stat shows the separation of diversity in New Jersey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the stats from New Providence I was curious to look at other towns surronding New Providence in the Union County area. I chose to look at the County Seat of the county, the town of Elizabeth. Elizabeth is a massive town in Union County and could really be called a city. Elizabeth is almost four times the size of New Providence with a population of 131,067 residents and 12.3 square miles in size. These states may have some impact of the higher crimes rates in Elizabeth than in New Providence, shown on the chart below. However, as we talked about before, the diversity in the city could be the reason as well and possibly income for families in the town. The different cultures in Elizabeth are vastly different than in New Providence with white population only being around 40% while in New Providence, it is around 80%. The difference in these two towns shows us the separation in communities with towns very close to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is obviously a difference in the population of the two towns in Union County with one being predominantly white and the other being very diverse. Another reason crime might have been impactful between these two towns is the affect from the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic put a lot of people and families out of work, leaving them to have to find new work with little money and support. This may have led people and others starting to possibly turn to crime to not only support themselves, but to support their own families and being able to put food on the table for others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at these two different cities, Union County obviously has two different areas where crime is always active and present. Elizabeth will continuously have numbers rising or staying high while New Providence will have their numbers low and steady. These reasons are not absolute, but it could be because of population, community surrounding, and current economic state of our country.

    After reviewing all these numbers, I wanted to talk to someone in one of these towns in Union County. I decided to talk to Lieutenant Stephen Drown, who is the Lieutenant of the New Providence Police Department, where my family and I live and grew up. Lieutenant Drown works to help the community and has previously served as a Corporal, Detective, Patrol Sergeant, Traffic Sergeant, and Patrol Commander. Since he is a key part in the protection and peace of the town, I wanted to get his insight on how his town has been able to preserve these low numbers.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Lieutenant Drown says "New Providence is a very small town, almost as small as an ant compared to the surrounding towns." Lieutenant Drown says that one key to the town having such low numbers is that indeed, the town is very small and is close to 3.7 square miles long. New Providence is the 69th largest city in New Jersey with only a small population of around 14,000 residents. Lieutenant Drown also says that the town and the police try to make communication between the two of them. Lieutenant Drown said "Communication is key and when the community has confidence when calling and approaching police, it allows us to break down cases and catch the disturbance as quickly as possible. We really do rely on help from the community to keep this town safe."
